# Sprint 2

#### Sam
For this sprint, I focused on creating a new working API call which will eventually be used to provide the latitude and longitude of contributors to a repo/repo group.  To achieve this, I followed the metric creation guide in the augur documentation, using their provided SQL query for practice.  I ended up with two files, a contributor-location.py file which defines the new metric, and a routes.py file, which creates the endpoint.  I also used my server to create and deploy my own instance of augur.  Althouh I was able to follow all the instructions successfully, the web app will not load when you try to access it.  I assume this is because of the issues we're facing right now with the servers.
