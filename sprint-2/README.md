# Sprint 2

#### Sam
For this sprint, I will be focusing on creating a working API endpoint that will return the results of a simple API call.  I will also deploy this new augur version to my server, so that the endpoint will be publicly accessible.

#### Michelle
I created a menu layout including all the repo groups in augur and a brief description of the projects. The future function of this is for the user to click on the repo group and the map will display the locations of the contributors in that repo group. It's still TBD if each repo group will have their own tab/page. I pinned Columbia, MO on the map to demonstrate the understanding of the Google Maps function.

#### Matthew
I am working on a metric that analyzes test coverage for repositories. The goal is to build a visual for the user to be able to clearly see how much each repo has been tested. I have written out the SQL query and python code but have not fully tested yet.
